# PDF Autoscroller

I needed an autoscroller to read a PDF of a book, and it was just as easy to vibecode one as it was to find one I actually liked.

## Features

- Smooth or page-by-page autoscroll
- Fine-grained speed control
- Chapter navigation (if the PDF has an outline)
- Keyboard shortcuts for everything
- Lazy loading for large PDFs

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser and drop in a PDF.
